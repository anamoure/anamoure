## About me ↴
I’m a 25-year-old student with a postgraduate degree in Library Science, expanding my knowledge into the field of IT, with a focus on big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I’m eager to learn everything I can about this area because it’s incredibly fascinating, and I feel that the knowledge I’ll gain could significantly contribute to improving people’s lives.

## Topics of study ↴
- Python
- Object-oriented programming
- SQL
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Graph Mining
- Analytical intelligence
- Cloud computing
- IoT
- Agile methodology
- Project management

## ~~My world domination plan~~ ↴
Since the world is a simulation, I’m going to learn the source code and analyze the data governing everyone's individual preferences and desires. This way, I’ll be able to create an algorithm to generate life experiences that make people happy and free of pain  (and create Hogwarts — that would be pretty cool too).
